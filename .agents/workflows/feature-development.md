# Feature Development Workflow

For this project, always adhere to the following workflow when developing any new feature, fix, or UI change:

1. **Create a new branch**: Always create a new branch off the main branch for the specific feature, fix, or UI change you are developing.
   // turbo
   git checkout -b <branch-name>

2. **Develop and Test**: Complete all necessary code changes and thoroughly test everything within that branch.

3. **Verify and Stabilize**: Ensure full verification and stability of the changes.

4. **Merge and Push**: Only after full verification, merge the branch back to the main branch and push the changes.
